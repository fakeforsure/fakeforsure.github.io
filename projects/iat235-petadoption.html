            <p><em class="normal bold">Project Objective:</em> The task was to make a website that would be user-friendly and accessible for pet adoption services.</p>
            <p><em class="normal bold">Why This Was a Problem:</em> Sites have lots of tabs and too many buttons to click. <em>How can we create a simple user flow that is no complicated, and easy to follow?</em></p>
            <ul><em class="normal bold">My Role & Contributions:</em>
                <li>Developed the main stylesheet structure for both content and grid.</li>
                <li>Designed clickable elements for user interaction, making sure each button is the same throughout for consistency.</li>
                <li>Chose the font and theme of the website to ensure a cohesive and appealing visual experience.</li>
                <li>Chose the images used throughout the site to complement the overall design and theme using only copyright-free images from Wikimedia.</li>
            </ul>
            <figure class="figure-article">
                <img class="img-article" src="../img/picks/iat235-petadoption2.png" alt="An image showcasing the Pet Adoption Services single pet page design">
                <figcaption>Showcase of the Pet Adoption Services single pet page design. The pet is featured on the left of the screen, while important information is on the right. The information is display in two clusters: quick facts with pet compatibility, and the description.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <ul><em class="normal bold">Challenges & Adaptations:</em>
                <li>Grids and layout adjustments for different screen sizes.</li>
                <li>Image optimization for faster loading times and better performance as some images were large.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul><em class="normal bold">Key Insights:</em>
                <li>Visually appealing design helps the user flow better through the website.</li>
                <li>Consistent navigation improves usability.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em class="normal bold">Reflection:</em> If I revisited this project, I would rework how images fit in the layout to ensure better visual harmony between the color palette of the website and the strong color of the photos.</p>
