                <figcaption>A labelled diagram of the “Tap&Go Audio Stick” concept. The stick has a yellow handle and a gray, square head. The front view shows a speaker grid and five tactile buttons: play, pause, stop, speed (hold), and volume (+/-). The back view has a screen labelled “TAP AREA ON PANEL (NFC).” The bottom view shows a USB-C connector for charging. The top and side views are blank. A lanyard is attached to the handle. Below are usage illustrations showing the stick tapping an NFC-tagged panel and sculpture.</figcaption>

            <p><em class="normal bold">Course & Date:</em> IAT 238 - Foundations of Design & User Experience - August 2025 (Summer 2025 Term).</p>
            <p><em class="normal bold">Collaborators:</em> John, Riley, Rita.</p>
            <p><em class="normal bold">Tools Used:</em> Figma, FigJam, user journey mapping, persona creation, and sketching.</p>
            <p><em class="normal bold">Project Objective:</em> We addressed an accessibility issue at the Bill Reid Gallery of Northwest Coast Art. Our challenge was: <em>How might we improve access to exhibition information for older adults facing vision, hearing, or language barriers?</em></p>
            <p><em class="normal bold">Why This Was a Problem:</em> Seniors often find overused QR codes, static wall text, or small labels difficult to engage with. Accessibility barriers can prevent them from fully experiencing cultural spaces.</p>
            <ul><em class="normal bold">My Role & Contributions:</em>
                <li>Led ideation sessions with the team and proposed the "Tap&Go Audio Stick."</li>
                <li>Designed the persona Landon Xue (65, impaired vision) to keep user needs central (user-centred goal).</li>
                <li>Refined key features: tactile buttons (play, pause, speed, volume), NFC-based activation, and multi-language audio.</li>
                <li>Documented how Indigenous voices could be incorporated to make content more inclusive.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul><em class="normal bold">Challenges & Adaptations:</em>
                <li>Accessibility-first thinking leads to more inclusive design outcomes.</li>
                <li>Small details, like tactile buttons and language options, make a big difference in usability.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul><em class="normal bold">Key Insights:</em>
                <li>Balancing technology with a simple layout to avoid overwhelming users while still making the device functional.</li>
                <li>Adapting design decisions after testing scenarios with personas.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em class="normal bold">Reflection:</em> If I revisited this project, I would prototype a working model for usability testing and gather direct feedback from older adults to validate assumptions.</p>
